    SELECT MAX(released_year)

    CODE: A Problem with Min and Max

    SELECT * FROM books 
    WHERE pages = (SELECT Min(pages) 
                    FROM books); 
     
    SELECT title, pages FROM books 
    WHERE pages = (SELECT Max(pages) 
                    FROM books); 
     
    SELECT title, pages FROM books 
    WHERE pages = (SELECT Min(pages) 
                    FROM books); 
     
    SELECT * FROM books 
    ORDER BY pages ASC LIMIT 1;
     
    SELECT title, pages FROM books 
    ORDER BY pages ASC LIMIT 1;
     
    SELECT * FROM books
